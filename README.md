# Crank It Up!

Crank It Up! is aA 1k1c (1 key 1 crank) rhythm game, involving, you guessed it, one key and one crank.

The game is currently in very, very early stages of development, barely past the basic concept phase.
So don't expect much yet!

The gameplay is currently planned to be like the following:

## Gameplay:

Layout: a circular screen with a crank handle in the middle.
Notes would move from the outer edges of the screen towards the centre.
A singular button would be cantered below the screen to act as both a start button and as an input for special notes

The game would work sort of like a circular version of OSU Catch, but using a crank handle instead of buttons, meaning it can move as fast as you physically can.
It would also have a single button to be occasionally used for special hit objects.

Hit objects would be normal notes for the slider, special notes for the button and “trick” notes requiring you to do a full rotation of the crank handle in the specified direction.
They could be used to force you to take the long way to the next note.

Red = moving handle
White = screen edges and stationary centre of handle 
Blue = example gameplay screen 

The V displayed near the handle represents the scoring line. Inside the V = ok, outside the V = not ok. You do not get any points for having a note hit the outside of the V.
